This repository contains the source files I produced for my Student Lead Independently Created Course in the summer of 2019.  
It contains a combination of tutorials and source files for my final project. Unfortunately I was unable to finish the project on time, so only the top-down racing game is functional.  
I completed tutorials in TensorFlow with the intention of integrating a system to train using the racing game.
